"""Gadget construction for QLDPC lattice surgery.

Primary reference: Webster, Smith, Cohen, arXiv:2511.15989 §II.A Steps 1-3,
an explicit pedagogically clean 3-step recipe for building a logical-X
measurement gadget on any CSS code. The default ``num_layers=1`` mode
implements Webster's 3 steps verbatim; ``num_layers > 1`` activates the
multi-layer fallback of Cross et al. 2024 (arXiv:2407.18393 §III) for codes
whose induced Tanner graph has insufficient boundary Cheeger constant.

The two formulations produce the same merged code at L=1: Webster's "gadget
qubit kappa_j for each adjacent Z-check S_j" = Cross's "C_1 ancilla qubit
at the same index as the C_0 Z-check"; Webster's "X-check chi_i wired to
kappa_j iff q_i in S_j" = Cross's `[Pi_V_0, F^T]` row pattern.

See docs/superpowers/specs/2026-06-05-cross-layered-ancilla-design.md for
the full paper traceability and design rationale.

    """Provenance of qubits and checks in a merged surgery code.

    Returned by ``build_layered_surgery_code`` alongside the merged ``CSSCode``.
    Downstream pipelines (circuit synthesis, decoder configuration, plotting)
    can use the layout to distinguish data qubits from ancilla and identify
    which check rows are gauge-fixing.

    Attributes:
        num_data_qubits: Number of qubits in the original data code.
        num_ancilla_qubits: Total ancilla qubits across all L layers.
        num_layers: L. Always odd, >= 1.
        qubit_layer: Length (num_data + num_ancilla) array. Value 0 marks a
            data qubit; values 1..L mark the layer index of an ancilla qubit.
        v0_indices: Indices (within data qubits) of supp(X̄_M) = V_0.
        c0_indices: Row indices (within H_Z of data code) of Z-checks adjacent
            to V_0 = C_0.
        F: Step-1 restriction matrix; shape (|C_0|, |V_0|), equal to
            ``data_code.matrix_z[c0_indices][:, v0_indices]``.
        G: Step-4 gauge-fix basis; rows span the left null space of F (i.e.
            ``G @ F == 0``); shape (rank(left_null(F)), |C_0|).
        hx_row_kind: Length (num_x_checks_merged) string array. Values:
            "data" for old X-checks, "ancilla_L{i}" for new X-checks added by
            odd layer i in {1, 3, ..., L}.
        hz_row_kind: Length (num_z_checks_merged) string array. Values:
            "data" for old Z-checks, "ancilla_L{i}" for new Z-checks added by
            even layer i in {2, 4, ..., L-1}, "gauge_fix" for U_L rows.

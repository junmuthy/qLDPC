"""Tier 1 noiseless correctness tests for mixed-basis joint PPM.

Mixed-basis joint Pauli-product measurement of X̄_l ⊗ Z̄_r is built on top
of the Cross, He, Rall, Yoder (arXiv:2407.18393) Theorem 20 subsystem-code
construction, specialized to the lattice-surgery setting by Cowtan, He,
Williamson, Yoder (arXiv:2503.05003 §3.5).

This module verifies the *Tier 1* (noiseless circuit build + DEM compile)
acceptance bar for the mixed-basis pipeline:
  * ``build_joint_ppm_circuit`` produces a ``stim.Circuit`` without
    asserting CSSCode (it dispatches to the subsystem-code-aware path).
  * The resulting circuit compiles to a ``stim.DetectorErrorModel``
    successfully — the syndrome graph for the pure-X / pure-Z stabilizer
    block is well-formed.

obs0 is NOT emitted in Tier 1. As of the split-schedule fix
(``_build_joint_ppm_circuit_mixed_basis`` runs X-stab CX gates and X-MX
in a fully separate phase BEFORE the Z-stab CZ gates begin), individual
χ_l / bridge_gauge measurement outcomes are deterministic in the
subsystem-code sense. However, the canonical
``⊕ m(χ_l) ⊕ ⊕ m(χ_r) ⊕ ⊕ m(bridge_gauges)`` formula remains
non-deterministic shot-to-shot because the operator product
X̄_l ⊗ Z̄_r ⊗ Z^|B| anti-commutes with the χ_l and bridge_gauge
X-on-adapter rows themselves (Z-on-adapter from ∏ χ_r anti-commutes
with X-on-adapter from individual χ_l). Per the design spec §9 Lemma 2
the full obs0 must additionally XOR in (i) Y-stab rows from the
pair-merge step and (ii) leftover X-cycle / Z-cycle outcomes. Those
extra Bridge fields are not yet populated by
``_stitch_to_joint_code_mixed`` — Tier 2 work. See
``_build_joint_ppm_circuit_mixed_basis`` docstring for full details.

The full truth-table verification (obs0 sign for all four |ψ_l⟩ ⊗ |ψ_r⟩
joint eigenstates) is captured below as ``xfail`` — see
``test_mixed_basis_joint_truth_table_x_l_z_r`` for the design-spec
limitation.

    incorrect: |0⟩ is not an X̄_l eigenstate when basis_l=X measures X̄_l,

    Tier 1: obs0 is intentionally not emitted (see

    Cross–He–Rall–Yoder formula
    ``⊕ m(χ_l) ⊕ ⊕ m(χ_r) ⊕ ⊕ m(bridge_gauges)`` is missing Y-stab and

    outcomes (a structural prerequisite for FT) but does NOT by itself
    close the operator-algebraic obs0 identity.

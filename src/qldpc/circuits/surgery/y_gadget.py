"""Logical-Y measurement gadget primitives (Ȳ = iX̄Z̄).

Building blocks for measuring a logical Y operator via lattice surgery in the
clean single-overlap regime of Cross, He, Rall, Yoder arXiv:2407.18393 §3.7,
where the logical-X support and the logical-Z support of the measured qubit
intersect on exactly one data qubit. That single shared qubit is where the
X̄ and Z̄ strings cross to realise Ȳ = iX̄Z̄.

This module provides:
    _locate_overlap  — validate an (x, z) representative pair and return the
                       index of their single shared (crossing) data qubit.
    _steane_y_pair   — a concrete Steane-code fixture (code, x, z) whose
                       logical-X / logical-Z supports overlap on exactly one
                       qubit, i.e. the §3.7 single-overlap case.
